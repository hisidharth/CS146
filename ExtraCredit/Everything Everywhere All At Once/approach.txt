For Matrix to list: loop over each row of the matrix. This will correspond to each node in the graph.
For each node, loop over its adjacent nodes by looping through the columns of the matrix.
Verify if an edge is between the current node "neighbor". (Check if 1 or 0)
If there's an edge, add the neighbor's index to the list of neighbors for the current node.


For list to matrix: For each node-neighbor pair, 
set the corresponding place in the adjacency matrix to 1 as opposed to 0. 
This shows there is an edge between the node and its neighbor.

For each node and its neighbors the code will reverse the direction of each edge.
We do this by iterating through the list of neighbors for each node and 
add to the reversed graph where the neighbor becomes the key, and the vertex becomes a value in the list: thus reversing the graph
