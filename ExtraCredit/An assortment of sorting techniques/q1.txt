In class, we briefly discussed that Merge Sort was stable, and Quick Sort is unstable.
Why would this property be useful? Is there an issue 
if this property does not hold good for a sorting algorithm?

Stability is important when thinking about sorting algorithms 
because of the various types of user inputs the problem could be dealing with.

For example, if we know for a fact that the constriants of a certain problem do not allow for duplicate values. 
Then we can use an unstable algorithm becuase it does not matter how we handle the order of duplicates.

But if we are given duplicate values in a set that we have to sort. 
We should be able to always preserve the relative order of the duplicate elements.
Relative order is especially important when sorting elements based on multiple keys. 

Stability may not seem like a huge issue when sorting things like numbers becuase identical numbers 
can shift their relative order and we as humans will not be able to detect the change.
But when sorting more complex values and objects we want our sorting to be predictable especially if we are sorting based on differnt keys, 
for example employee names, their age, and id numbers. If two people have the same name, our sorting algorithm should presrve their relative order
For the future sorting of their age and id numbers
