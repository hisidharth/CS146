For this approach I decided to use a minHeap to keep track of server values. 
First I decided to sort the given intervals based on the starting value. 
Then I use a minHeap to keep track of the end times for the servers.
Then we check if the start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the meeting at the top of the minHeap.
If this is the case, the current interval can reuse the room of the meeting that just ended. 
We then pop this earliest ending meeting from the minHeap.
