I used a hashset for this approach.  I first sort the input array and then iterate 
until the second to last elemtent.
Now we try to find the opposite of the current element and use two pointers 
to find two elemnts that add up to that target value.
We can find triplets like this but we still need to account for duplicates. 
I use a hashset to store triplets. This ensures no duplicates. 
After I process all triplets into the hashset, I then add the contents of the set into result and return result.
