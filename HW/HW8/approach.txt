For this approach I used a hasmap to store the frequency of each character in the inputed string.
From there, if the frequency of the character is even, we can then include the character (and all its appearences) in the palindrome.
If the frequency of the character is odd, then we can include one less of the character in the palindrome. 
If there was at least one character with an odd frequency 
we can add one to the length because we need a center to the palindrome.
