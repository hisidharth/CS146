In this approach, I decided to use two helper methods to find the cheapest pipe possible
and the cheapest possible well. 

I check the pipes outgoing from visited houses and compare those costs, to the well cost. 
Depending on which one is cheaper I add that cost to the total cost and mark it as visited. 
I also account for the bidirectional nature of these pipes as well with two if statements.

In the case that the costs are the same I default to the pipe cost for the sake of consistency but
if I changed the approach to default the well cost, the code would not change outputs because of the way my comparisons work in the helper methods.

The reason I set some variables to infinity at first is because I am accounting for any size of input.
