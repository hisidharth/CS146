For this problem I decided to use arrays and compare the two strings.
I first made sure the strings were the same size.
I then populate a character array for each string and then sort the strings so if they are anagrams of eachther, the sorted version of these strings should be idenctial.
After sorting I compare the strings and if they are the same, return true, if not return false.
